Hi there, I believe we've never met. My name is Kobe, after the infamous Kobe Bryant. Little fun fact: my middle name was supposed to be Bryant, but my dad decided on Brandon. I was born in O'ahu, lived here my whole life in Mililani. I have a lot of different hobbies that I like to do every now and then when I am not busy. I can play golf, tennis, some ukulele, video games (of course), and the usual bingeing of tv shows and movies.

I currently work at the UH Manoa Bookstore as a Fiscal student, so you won't probably see me on the Floor with all the customers. I get a lot of work tossed my way, but this job is made easier since I work with some of the best coworkers who knows how to mess around, but still get all our work done for the day.

These next few semester will be a struggle for me, but seeing as everybody else is working just as hard with way more responsibilities, inspires me to work like them.
