I wanted to become an MIS major because I had a passion for technology. Growing up in this new age of technology gave me inspiration to have my life revolve around it. I'm hoping that from MIS, I can develop my skills in numbers & data and be able to incorporate that into a business viewpoint.

My hopes for a future in a technical field has opened up after being apart of the Shidler College of Business. I've always had a love for math & science.
