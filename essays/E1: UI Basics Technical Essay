After finishing up all three WODs, I felt pretty accomplished. The way I went about doing the WODs was by looking at the directions on what was needed and then reviewed it on one of the HTML/CSS websites. After I felt confident in my abilities, I tried doing BrowserHistory1, and it took me about 17 minutes on my first try. I didn't want to do it again seeing that I made the time and it was pretty long of a WOD compared to the other two. 
I went on to read about CSS in what I needed to understand and completed BrowserHistory2. Since it was so short I decided to spend more time on it and went and did 3 tries in total, getting my time down to about 3 minutes. CSS wasn't as bad because it was mainly customization of the first html file.
When attempting to do BrowserHistory3, I got stuck since one of the tags weren't working or so I thought. I wasn't sure why it wasn't working because after deleting and doing it over again, it somehow worked. I was sure I did typed the same code too. I had to do that one twice before I watched the screencast to understand the WOD. After my third try, I ended with about 9 minutes.
Overall, I had a lot of fun doing them, despite how frustrating one of them were. It still feels like I did something and learned more from it.
