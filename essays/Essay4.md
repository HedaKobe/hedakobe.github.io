  My progress in programming this semester has greatly increased since I started this class. I have a great understanding of HTML and CSS now and am slowly getting better with my JavaScript. I am not too confident with Javascript but at least know enought to make a server for a website. 
  With programming, I notice I have a lot of enthusiasim with programming since I get excited when something works the way I want it to.
    When it comes to the WOD's, the earlier WOD's I was able to do without watching the screen cast. Recently, I have been trying to do it but fail and need to review the screencast to be able to understand what I needed to do. After looking at it once, I was able to do the WOD with ease. Most of the time I have trouble with how they want the formatting of code to look, but I understand the logic of what I need to do to get the criteria for the WOD. 
  I enjoy the labs very much. At first, I don't understand that much since my main goal is to try to follow along and complete the lab. After looking over the lab on my own, I am slowly understanding what each component of code does.
  Assignment was a big challenge for me, but after completing it, I have more confidence to attempt to do the next assignments in the coming future.
  The class can be improved in a few ways. I noticed that in certain steps of the lab, some students begin to fall behind. Though, I am usually not one of them, I try to keep up and read into the labs later to know what each component does.
  I very much enjoy the follow-along labs because you explain what we are doing and what the code does. The code that I look at usually doesn't make sense until you explain it and it really helps when you do explain.
