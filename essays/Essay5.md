**1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details**

The goal of assignment2 was to make an e-store where we purchase a product under a specific login. If we didn't have a login we would have to register our information to access the invoice with our purchase. Details of Assignment2 can be found [here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html).

**2. What did you learn from this assignment?**

I learned that coding takes a lot of patience and is a slow process. I'm still getting used to taking it slow though. It was a constant struggle and I find myself hitting numerous walls as I tried to complete this assignment by myself. 

**3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).**

I worked on this assignment alone for the most part and consulted many people to get my end result.

**4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?**

I either went into professor Port's office hours or I reviewed another students Github to see why theirs is working but mine isn't. I needed help sending the query strings so that they pass through multiple pages.

**5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?**

Developing this assignment had a lot more requirements and took a lot of lines of code and time to complete. Personally, it was a lot more complicated to grasp what the goal of the website was. Looking back, Assignment 1 was fairly basic and the more we add to these websites I start to see how much more complex websites actually are.

**6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging**

I would say I spent about 10% thinking about how to do something. Then would spend 40% writing the code, and the last 50% testing and debugging. It was by my mistake that I was tossing in chunks of code and running a test to see what I need to fix until it stopped giving me errors.

**7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?**

Nothing per say worked well for me, it was always such a struggle. Spending hours staring at the code not knowing what is going on was not working so well.

**8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?**

If I could go back in time, I would start sooner and work with a purpose. Majority of the time I was unmotivated to write the code cause I would be confused and frustrated.
