Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details


What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned that coding takes a lot of patience and is a slow process. I'm still getting used to taking it slow though.

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I worked on this assignment alone for the most part and consulted many people to get my end result.

How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I either went into professor Port's office hours or I reviewed another students Github to see why theirs is working but mine isn't. I needed help sending the query strings so that they pass through multiple pages.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
Developing this assignment had a lot more requirements and took a lot of lines of code and time to complete.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I would say I spent about 10% thinking about how to do something. Then would spend 40% writing the code, and the last 50% testing and debugging.

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
Nothing per say worked well for me, it was always such a struggle. Spending hours staring at the code not knowing what is going on was not working so well.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back in time, I would start sooner and work with a purpose. Majority of the time I was unmotivated to write the code cause I would be confused and frustrated.
